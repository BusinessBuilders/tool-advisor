# Tool Advisor Plugin

Intelligently analyze installed plugins, skills, and agents to recommend the best tools for any given project or task.

## Overview

Tool Advisor helps you leverage your full Claude Code toolkit by:
- 🔍 Scanning and indexing all installed plugins, skills, and agents
- 🎯 Recommending the best tools for your tasks
- 💡 Proactively suggesting relevant tools during conversations
- 📚 Helping you discover capabilities you didn't know you had

## Features

### Commands

- **`/tool-advisor:recommend [task]`** - Get tool recommendations for a specific task
  ```bash
  /tool-advisor:recommend "deploy to production"
  /tool-advisor:recommend --task "code review" --prefer agent
  ```

- **`/tool-advisor:scan-tools`** - Scan and index all available tools
  ```bash
  /tool-advisor:scan-tools
  ```

- **`/tool-advisor:show-capabilities`** - List all available tools
  ```bash
  /tool-advisor:show-capabilities
  /tool-advisor:show-capabilities --all
  ```

### Agents

- **tool-scanner** - Automatically scans `.claude/` directories for capabilities
- **recommendation-engine** - Matches tasks to the best available tools
- **proactive-advisor** - Suggests relevant tools during conversations

### Skills

- **Plugin Discovery & Analysis** - Techniques for discovering and analyzing installed tools
- **Recommendation Strategies** - Algorithms for matching tasks to tools

### Hooks

- **pre-tool-call** - Checks for better specialized tools before execution
- **post-tool-call** - Suggests alternatives after tool execution
- **conversation-start** - Auto-scans tools when Claude starts
- **user-prompt-submit** - Proactively suggests tools based on user requests

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Claude Code v1.0.0 or later
- Bash (for utility scripts)

### Install Plugin

```bash
# Plugin is already installed at:
~/.claude/plugins/tool-advisor/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.claude/plugins/tool-advisor/
```

## Configuration

Create `.claude/tool-advisor.local.md` in your project or home directory to customize behavior:

```yaml
# Enable/disable proactive suggestions
proactive_suggestions: true

# Auto-use tool if confidence exceeds this threshold
auto_use_threshold: 0.90

# Show suggestion if confidence exceeds this threshold
suggestion_threshold: 0.70

# Scan tools on conversation start
scan_on_start: true

# Scan frequency: hourly, daily, manual
scan_frequency: hourly

# Directories to scan (defaults shown)
scan_directories:
  - ~/.claude/plugins/
  - ~/.claude/skills/
  - ./.claude/

# Verbosity: quiet, normal, verbose
verbosity: normal

# Show match percentages in recommendations
show_scores: true

# Exclude plugins matching these patterns
exclude_plugins:
  - "legacy-*"
  - "deprecated-*"

# Preferred tools for specific task types
preferred_tools:
  deploy: "cloud-infrastructure"
  review: "code-review-ai"
  test: "tdd-workflows"
```

## Usage Examples

### Get Recommendations

```bash
# Simple recommendation
/tool-advisor:recommend "review this pull request"

# Structured recommendation
/tool-advisor:recommend --task "deploy to AWS" --prefer agent --exclude "legacy-*"
```

### Scan Your Tools

```bash
# Full scan with progress
/tool-advisor:scan-tools

# Quiet scan (updates cache silently)
/tool-advisor:scan-tools --quiet
```

### Browse Capabilities

```bash
# Grouped view
/tool-advisor:show-capabilities

# Full view with examples
/tool-advisor:show-capabilities --all
```

## How It Works

### 1. Discovery Phase

The tool-scanner agent scans:
- `~/.claude/plugins/` - User plugins
- `~/.claude/skills/` - User skills
- Project `.claude/` directory
- Connected MCP servers
- Built-in Claude Code tools

### 2. Indexing

Creates searchable index at `.claude/tool-advisor-cache.json` containing:
- Tool names and types
- Capabilities and descriptions
- Keyword mappings
- Usage metadata

### 3. Recommendation Engine

When you describe a task, the recommendation engine:
1. Analyzes your request (keywords, intent, context)
2. Searches the capability index
3. Scores matches using multi-factor algorithm:
   - Keyword match: 35%
   - Capability type: 25%
   - User history: 20%
   - Tool freshness: 10%
   - Success rate: 10%
4. Returns ranked recommendations

### 4. Proactive Suggestions

During conversations, the proactive-advisor agent:
- Monitors for task keywords (deploy, test, review, etc.)
- Detects question patterns ("how do I", "can you help")
- Checks error contexts for relevant tools
- Suggests tools inline: "💡 Using: [tool-name] (94% match)"

## Troubleshooting

### Cache Issues

If recommendations seem stale:
```bash
/tool-advisor:scan-tools
```

### No Recommendations

Check that cache exists:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/tool-advisor-cache.json
```

### Disable Proactive Mode

Edit `.claude/tool-advisor.local.md`:
```yaml
proactive_suggestions: false
```
